# Antwerp-Airbnb-2023-Excel-Tableau-Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Antwerp Airbnb Investment Analysis project! This repository is dedicated to helping individuals interested in the Airbnb business in Antwerp make informed decisions. The 2023 Antwerp Airbnb dataset from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) has been transformed into an interactive dashboard filled with valuable insights.

## Purpose

### Supporting Your Airbnb Investment Journey

The primary purpose of this project is to empower you, whether you're a seasoned entrepreneur or a newcomer to the world of Airbnb, with data-driven insights to make informed investment decisions in Antwerp's vibrant short-term rental market.

The project aims to provide answers to essential questions that every potential investor might have:

- **Where to Invest**: Discover the optimal neighborhoods in Antwerp for your Airbnb property investment. Consider factors such as demand, occupancy rates, and pricing trends to pinpoint lucrative opportunities.

- **Pricing Strategies**: Gain insights into how pricing relates to occupancy rates. Should you charge more during peak seasons or opt for competitive pricing year-round? The analysis can guide your pricing strategy.

- **Property Types**: Understand the performance of different property types, from entire homes to private rooms. Make informed decisions about the type of property that suits your investment goals.

- **Guest Satisfaction**: Delve into average review scores by neighborhood to gauge guest satisfaction levels. High satisfaction can lead to repeat bookings and positive word-of-mouth.

- **Revenue Potential**: Estimate your potential yearly revenue based on various property characteristics. Get a realistic view of your investment's income-generating potential.

## Data Preparation

- The `airbnb_antwerp_2023_dataset` Excel file includes the dataset with listings and calendar tables.
- Joined two essential tables, namely `listings` and `calendar`, to enrich the dataset for more comprehensive analysis. This data preparation step enabled me to perform better analytics and generate the visualizations you'll find in the dashboard.

### Interactive Exploration

The Tableau-based interactive dashboard allows you to explore the data effortlessly. You can filter listings by room type, review score, occupancy rate, and the number of bedrooms. Additionally, you have the flexibility to highlight specific neighborhoods to focus your analysis on particular areas of interest.
